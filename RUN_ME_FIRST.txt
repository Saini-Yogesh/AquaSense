⚠️ IMPORTANT: RUN THIS SCRIPT BEFORE STARTING THE AQUSENCE PROJECT ⚠️

Before running the project, make sure your current working directory is:
    /aqusence/

This setup step is REQUIRED to install all necessary dependencies for both
the frontend and backend. The project WILL NOT run correctly if you skip this.

👉 Once you are in the /aqusence/ folder, run the following command in PowerShell:



cd frontend; npm install; cd ../backend; npm install; cd ..



✅ After this completes successfully, you can start the project as usual.
